    "text": "Due date: February 12th 2026\n\nDNA sequencing can be broadly defined as the determination of the identity and order of nucleic acid residues in biological samples. Bioinformatic analysis and sequencing results are greatly affected by the choice of sequencing technology. Sequencing technologies can be broadly categorized in three groups:\n\nFirst-Generation Sequencing\n\nFirst-generation sequencing methods, mostly notably Sanger sequencing, relied on using radio- or fluorescently-labelled dNTPs or oligonucleotides before electrophoretic analysis.\n\nSecond-Generation Sequencing\n\nSecond-generation sequencing is characterized by its high throughput due to the parallelisation of a large number of reactions, sequencing thousands to millions of DNA fragments. Second-Generation sequencing includes the current sequencing leader, Illumina.\n\nThird-Generation Sequencing\n\nThird-generation sequencing technologies include those capable of sequencing single molecules, so they don’t require DNA amplification. The two most common third-generation sequencing technologies include PacBio (Pacific Biosciences) and ONT (Oxford Nanopore).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration\nSequencing Technology\nYear\nCompany\nAvg Read Length\nCost per Gigabase\n\n\n\n\nFirst Generation\nSanger Sequencing\n1977\nFrederick Sanger\n~800 bp\nVery High (&gt;$1000)\n\n\nSecond Generation\n454 Sequencing\n2005\nRoche\n~400 bp\nHigh ($100 - $500)\n\n\n\nIllumina (Solexa)\n2006\nIllumina\n~150-300 bp\nLow ($1 - $10)\n\n\n\nIon Torrent\n2010\nThermo Fisher\n~200 bp\nMedium ($10 - $50)\n\n\nThird Generation\nPacBio SMRT\n2009\nPacific Biosciences\n10,000+ bp\nHigh ($50 - $200)\n\n\n\nOxford Nanopore\n2014\nONT\n10,000+ bp\nMedium-High ($10-$100)\n\n\n\nWe will use a human genome standard (HG002) that has been extremely well-characterized as our gold standard. The HG002 genome assembly is part of an effort hosted by NIST that includes The Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium, the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium and the Genome in a Bottle Consortium, to sequence, assemble and polish the HG002 (also known as GM24385 and huAA53E0) cell line.\nSome reference papers regarding this dataset:\n\nZook, J., Catoe, D., McDaniel, J. et al. Extensive sequencing of seven human genomes to characterize benchmark reference materials.
